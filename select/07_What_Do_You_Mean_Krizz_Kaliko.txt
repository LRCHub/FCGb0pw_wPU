If it was niggas at it I could see me, wouldn't be glasses
Wouldn't be nothing, cause nothing get past us, right?
Foot on the throttle and hand on the bottle
I'm liking the model, she following me
Loving her cause she get custody of all of my kids
She swallowing, swallowing, damn
Gotta watch this one
He's a son of a gun and a Watson son
Ever wanted to see him just hit a blunt and believe in me
The way I'm talking about the [?] man pops his gun
I think I love this nigga
I love them big boys, but better not get no bigger
Aye, aye, what do you mean?
I was getting dough way before
You didn't know so what do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, you didn't know so what do you mean?
What did you mean?
I was bussing 'fore you could cuss
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Ain't nobody's fucking with us
What do you mean, what do you mean?
I was Strange, baby, even before becoming the team
If haters gon' jump to conclusions
I'll push 'em off while they bungie jump
I'm cutting the string
I'm clutching this Tech and I'm from the regime
This shit can get ugly like one for the team
I fuck bad bitches, that's a wonderful thing
Then that pussy go brrr, money machine
Y'all can never fuck with the team
I'm past you niggas
I'm like the buffering screen
Load a gas and niggas call my cutlass supreme
Bro get laughing at 'em while we be puffing this cream
Flexing, living, look at all this effin' definition
When the heffers get it, they'll see me and ask
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
I'm getting dough way before
You didn't know so what do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, you didn't know so what do you mean?
What did you mean?
I was bussing 'fore you was cussing
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Ain't nobody's fucking with
What do you mean, what do you mean?
